# DERbP - Draw Entity Relationship bluePrints ✎🖇️

DERbP is a web application that parses SQL queries and uses a force-directed drawing algorithm to generate Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams, following Chen notation.

## Technologies Used 🚀

- **JavaScript**: Express backend (planned migration to Rust).
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend.
- **Force-Directed Drawing**: Algorithm for creating ER diagrams.

## Features 🛠️

- Generate an ER diagram from an SQL query (work in progress).

## Challenges 🤯

- Tweaking the algorithm parameters for stability.
- Ongoing refinement for better results.

## Future Work 📈

- Implement an SQL parser, preferably on the client side.
- Accept uploaded SQL files.
- Optimize the drawing algorithm's performance.
- Achieve better stability and quality in generated diagrams.
